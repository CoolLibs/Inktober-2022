# 03 - Bubbles

> I am really happy with how the distribution of the circles turned out. In order to avoid overlapping circles I did put each of them in a different cell of a Voronoi grid, and gave them a radius equal to the size of the cell. This makes sure they almost touch, but never overlap.
We could also compute a random number for each cell and hide some of the circles based on that if we wanted a sparser distribution.
